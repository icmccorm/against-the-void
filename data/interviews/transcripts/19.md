**Interviewer**\
Awesome. So to get started, from my first question, what have been your motivations for learning Rust and choosing to use it? 

***Participant***\
Come again? 

**Interviewer**\
What have been your motivations for learning Rust and for choosing to use it? 

***Participant***\
For me, using Rust I think it's easy to learn and also to apply and also it's integration with the other programming languages, it's easy. And so I feel it's convenient for me to work with.

**Interviewer**\
So how is that transition then to what you were using before Rust then to using Rust in your applications?

***Participant***\
I think transition was quite transformative. And okay, switching to Rust, maybe a hard task, I would say as per say, and I was so glad to have discovered Rust. And it's something I was introduced to my colleagues who are working on together on the projects. As you know, when it comes to programming languages, sometimes you get to learn them just because you're gonna be using them. So, okay, when it comes to Rust and its applicability, you know, when it comes to application, maybe in a third program, maybe web development, some kind of such, you get, it's easier to change it with the programming languages and to synchronize. So for me, it's been a good experience. And I think I like using Rust as per say.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So it's like the integration of other languages that you particularly like about it.

***Participant***\
Yeah, yeah, that's it.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. And which languages have you typically been using?

***Participant***\
Sorry for that. So, come again? Yeah, I've used multiple languages. I've used Ruby, I've used JavaScript, I've used Java, Python, C++, C++, C. I've used multiple languages. Yeah, so, yeah.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. And then when you use unsafe Rust, what are you using it for then?

***Participant***\
Mostly it's for, maybe, web development or maybe, yeah, mostly web development.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So is it that you were, I guess, so you're using Rust in these web applications, like where does the Rust come in? Is it a part of your backend or are you like using it when it's compiled to WebAssembly and having that running in the browser? And having that running in the browser?

***Participant***\
Okay, let's say it's the backend, but sometimes I do accept this to run it all together.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha, okay. And so I guess more specifically in the backend, like when would you need to use unsafe to do something?

***Participant***\
Um, maybe when I want to, to interface with some kind of low level API or something.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. Any particular APIs that you can think of?...Oh yeah, sure. So you were talking sometimes when you're working with Rust in the backend, you have to use unsafe to access low level APIs. Like what types of APIs would you be accessing?

***Participant***\
Maybe credit and private libraries, maybe the point in system API, so maybe foreign functional interfaces, such kind of APIs.

**Interviewer**\
So like, what's an example, I guess you mentioned that the thing you'd like a lot about Rust is compatibility with different languages. Like what's, what's important of a situation where you needed to use Rust foreign function interface? Come again? What's a situation where you needed to use unsafe to call a foreign function?

***Participant***\
Maybe when I want to, I want maybe to review calls or maybe to do some kind of outing or maybe abstraction.

**Interviewer**\
Yeah. Gotcha. So I guess, but like what, like in the last application you worked on where you had to call a foreign function, like what, what was that foreign code doing for your Rust application?

***Participant***\
Mostly, maybe clipping or maybe creating some force politics or maybe learning cars or maybe compile time errors, some kind of, it matters to me, kind of maybe what I'm working on. I'm not, so I guess I wasn't quite understanding what you meant there.

**Interviewer**\
I mean, like, or at least with, with compile time errors, like, I guess I was more curious about like what was the role of the foreign code in that application? Like, I guess with, with one of my projects where it's using the FFI, I have part of it that is in Rust, which is interpreting this one particular file format. And then there's another library in C that I have which interprets a different file format. And because I need this project to interpret both of those formats, I have to use the FFI to be able to like use that C library. So like, I guess what I'm curious about is in your applications in Rust, where you are using both Rust code and code in some other language to do something together. Like, what's the role of the code in that other language? Like, what is it accomplishing for you in that, in that Rust application?

***Participant***\
I think, I think it's true to some, maybe dependency management or maybe to compile maybe a code or maybe mostly to just build configurations for the purpose of, of maybe tweaking or maybe, you know, creating some conditional compilation targeting specific, maybe platform or something to just to make it, you know.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So is it like certain platforms only supports? Like, so there are, there are like cases where because a certain platform is like it is, you'd need to call a foreign function on that platform like in place of what you'd use a Rust function for?

***Participant***\
Yes, yeah.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha, gotcha. What would, I guess, what prevents you from just using Rust everywhere? Like, why, why would you need to have foreign code at all? So like, in these applications, what's preventing you from, like, is there a reason why you have to use a foreign function in those cases? Like, could you potentially have everything rewritten in Rust or is that just like way too much work or impossible for some other particular reason?

***Participant***\
Yeah, maybe I have to consider maybe other things like memory safety or maybe, you know, something that you can get results from this and define behavior of which you're going to have challenges trying to work it through. And so I try to talk with that just because it can be difficult to identify and resolve bugs and it's an upheaval task to go through that. Also, maybe, sometimes maybe code maintenance or refactoring, I have to consider that, especially when we are working as a group or people outside, maybe a particular project, I have to share my codes. I have to consider other people, maybe to do some kind of refactoring and I live into it.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha, gotcha. So, I guess, is that just... So, it's preferable then for you to use as little unsafe code or foreign function calls as possible because it would be easier for other collaborators to understand the safe code and avoid errors?

***Participant***\
Yes, the safe.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So then have there been challenges like that where you've been working with someone else and they just haven't quite understood what your code is doing and then that causes an issue?

***Participant***\
Yes, there have been challenges, especially with people who are not quite... they are not quite familiar with unsafe rust or maybe the rust programming algorithm, maybe they are trying to learn it or they are not so proficient with it. So, there have been challenges, but I got some challenges. So, I would say it has happened got some time, several times, that is.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha, gotcha. So then my next question. So, it seems like the motivation that you have for using unsafe is to call foreign functions and that's required for a particular platform or architecture. Are there any other motivations that you might choose to use unsafe? Do you ever replace something with an unsafe bit of code to increase performance, or is it just for the foreign function calls?

***Participant***\
Okay, don't really understand what you mean. We can replace that. Sure, yes.

**Interviewer**\
One practice that some developers do is if you just write things in safe rust, you might have a lot of extra bounds checks that are inserted by the compiler or you might end up using a bunch more memory space for how rust types work. So, instead of just using safe everywhere, sometimes developers will introduce unsafe code to skip certain bounds checks or to attempt to use less space to increase performance. Have you ever done that, or is it really just because you need to use foreign functions that you use unsafe?

***Participant***\
No, I think, okay, I can reference from your previous from your issue question. Apart from maybe the need to apply unsafe rust in foreign functions, I use unsafe rust just to maybe do some unsafe abstractions. And that is to use unsafe rust just to create safe abstraction. And this may be involved, maybe writing a safe API around unsafe implementation. In these operations, it just can work around implementation details and I think when it comes to unsafe rust, it won't be to use it to create abstractions to work better than maybe most of programming languages and a lot of other things that I use unsafe rust for. And also, maybe writing a low level code that maybe I'm needed to share maybe a collaborator for future reference for other programmers or users.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So what's one of these abstractions that you've had to write with unsafe? What's an example of some sort of tool or pattern that you had to use unsafe to implement and then had to make a safe API around it?

***Participant***\
Yeah. I had to appear to this minute. I've been postponing it on and off and I'll put that today. 

**Interviewer**\
No worries. I mean, we can always reschedule it. So no worries whatsoever. 

***Participant***\
No, no. I think we can just continue. I can handle it. [unknown]?

**Interviewer**\
Yeah. So I guess the question was, what's a specific example of a part of your program where you had to use unsafe to create some sort of abstraction and then you created like a safe API around it?

***Participant***\
Yeah. It would be an instance where I'm creating an unsafe function which mostly associated with an implementation type or maybe the requirement of maybe to perform a low level operations or interface with the external resources in some kind of unsafe manner. And so this can be a trend maybe as unsafe function or maybe that could be a safe method and mostly safe methods and so I required to provide default implementation which can create maybe some kind of consumer traits or maybe unsafe operations or maybe we can create some kind of RAST or maybe safety guarantees. And these safety guarantees when it comes to Rust, I think they are much useful when you're creating with multiple APIs and they have some kind of screenization behavior in these calls for security and also have maybe less bugs or less challenges trying to implement and I think those have got a way to let others more applicable with Rust.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. Gotcha. So are there cases where you can't expose something as like a safe API or that you choose for some reason to just expose like an unsafe function to people?

***Participant***\
Yeah, I think that's mostly just it. Yeah.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So when you do write an unsafe function and expose it to people, do you like write documentation for it to describe how to use it correctly?

***Participant***\
Yes. You have to write documentation. You have to write a documentation for it.

**Interviewer**\
So what's an example of something that you would document for one of those functions?

***Participant***\
Maybe let's say I call this supposed to perform a low level operation and in this instance, it's also supposed to run some kind of unsafe safety guarantees. So you have to write a documentation to instructs in some kind of file that the code can be handled and I think that's the right way to do it just avoid backlogs and maybe pointer dereferencing or some kind of, yeah.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So it would be something like with a pointer that it has to be a valid pointer?

***Participant***\
Yeah.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. And so then with, let me just double check something. So with your screening survey, one of the questions was about different memory container types that you might have used with raw pointers or like to contain raw pointers and you selected Box, unsafe cell, rough cell and lazy cell. So could you talk a bit about where you'd use those with unsafe code? Maybe starting with Box. Like what's the situation where you've used Box with like in an unsafe context?

***Participant***\
I think with Box, it's good to use it in building configurations and that is in a number, or maybe a different features, or maybe some kind of conditional computation or targeting specific platforms that may require understanding or tweaking the project's cargo or some kind of, some kind of maybe, some kind of challenging configuring builds that need to be correctly trained or maybe developing specifics for it.

**Interviewer**\
I guess how does Box in particular help you there? Like are you, like what are you using the type to do in those cases where you need conditional compilation? Like when you call Box new and create a new Box, like what is it containing?

***Participant***\
Maybe it contains maybe some compile codes or builds or maybe last installations or some kind of commands for creating pure new tests or maybe publishing the last projects or some kind of, yeah.

**Interviewer**\
I guess, so is it that you have this like struct that contains all of these commands and then you need to allocate it so you put it into a Box?

***Participant***\
Yeah.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. And then what about unsafe cell? Like where do you use unsafe cell?

***Participant***\
Well, unsafe cell will be what took my performance and reliability. Then I can maybe do some maybe targeted ideas or maybe integration with coeditors or some kind of building some reliability cross sections or coeds in a project. You know.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So is it like when would you, because I know RefCell can be used in a similar way to UnsafeCell. So like when would you choose to use unsafe cell instead of RefCell?

***Participant***\
Well, I was saying. 

**Interviewer**\
Still there? Can you hear me? 

***Participant***\
I can hear you now. I can hear you. I think you made it now though Well, I was saying. Yeah, so I'm saying. It's a light weight and it's a little container. And so it has the capability of holding single values and also provides interior mutability. That's quite a very nice instrument. They are just because it allows values to mutate directly, even when only mutable.

**Interviewer**\
I'm sorry. I don't think I think you just muted. Can you hear me? Oh, I can hear you now. 

***Participant***\
Yep. I don't know what's happening here. Yeah, so I'm saying, yeah, do you hear my point? 

**Interviewer**\
Yeah. Yeah. So it's just a more lightweight container than ref cell.

***Participant***\
Yeah. Yeah.

**Interviewer**\
So have there been situations where you've like tested something with ref cell and then compared it to unsafe cell like a difference in performance?

***Participant***\
Yes. Yes.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So like how significant was the difference in performance?

***Participant***\
Okay. It's not a major significant performance, but I'll say there's a substantial difference.

**Interviewer**\
Okay. I want to choose to motivate you to choose one or the other. Yeah. I guess what's the situation? So when do you choose to use an unsafe cell? Like what's the situation where you think, yeah, no, I need to use an unsafe cell for this because of some particular reason, like what's what would the reason be?

***Participant***\
Um, maybe when I want to create, maybe I want to allow multiple references to be contained in a particular body or maybe when I want to, maybe I have concurrent and multi threaded application. So in such instances, then it's a preference.

**Interviewer**\
Sure. That makes sense. Um, and then when do you use lazy cell?

***Participant***\
Um, with lazy cell, okay. Don't know. Maybe it's mostly, but maybe it's useful for me. Uh, when I need to store a value, um, uh, on the heap or other than me, then we prefer to store a value in a heap or other than. 

**Interviewer**\
Hello. Yeah, I hear your audio cut out there. So I didn't hear your response. 

***Participant***\
Yeah. Um, yeah, somebody, I'm using my phone and someone was calling me. So, um, did you get my points? 

**Interviewer**\
Uh no, I, I don't think I heard what you, what you said about, um, when you use lazy cell. 

***Participant***\
Um, maybe when I want to, uh, to store values, uh, on the heap, maybe not the, uh, no, rather maybe not this time. Maybe, maybe when I want to require some kind of presence to control over the memory location. So maybe in such instances.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. I guess, um, how would that be different than using a Box, right? Because with a Box, you get a heap allocation.

***Participant***\
Um, yeah. Um, so that would be different in just because, uh, with a Box, you can be able to create, uh, exercise containers. But, uh, with lazy cells, um, it's only maybe it's dynamically sized. So, uh, like Boxs, some kind of a difference there. Confusion, maybe working through both of them.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. Wait, so it's that you use both of them together or?

***Participant***\
No, not together. It's really, it's possible.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. Um, so is, uh, Just a second. Um, Gotcha. Um, so then. All right. I guess, when would you choose to use a lazy cell instead of a RefCell then, or just a normal cell? Like what, why would you need that sort of delayed initialization?

***Participant***\
Um, Maybe, um, Okay. In a, in a station, I want to maybe, uh, Do some kind of resizing, uh, Of really hard structures, uh, Yeah, in some kind of in such instances, maybe. And I don't want to be, Uh, the entire cells, maybe, yeah, it makes it, makes a sense, maybe take that.

**Interviewer**\
Wait, so it's, it's that you use it to get that you. Oh no, you're, you're. Yeah. Yeah. So is it, would you use it just to contain a value that you'd expect to be resized?

***Participant***\
Come again.

**Interviewer**\
Like is it, I guess I'm, I'm kind of confused. Is it something like what, why would needing to resize something mean that you'd need a lazy cell versus like a different structure?

***Participant***\
Maybe, maybe this is when I, when I, maybe, but you can be able to do this with a Box and it's when I'm required to, to put some precise control over, over memory allocation. So where I can, maybe I use Box entirely, although I have never used a lazy cell as much, but okay, maybe I'm saying I guess I'm, maybe I have not much experience with lazy cell as much. So actually, we, we built my tool to skip that question. So right now, it's living.

**Interviewer**\
So then with, so when you're using like foreign function code, you've mentioned using a couple of different tools. Like bind gen, C bind gen, Windows bind gen, Dart bind gen is also OCaml interrupt. Like what's, what's been your experience using these binding tools? Like have they been generally good experiences? Like what's, or have there been things that you've struggled with? Like what's your general experience using these tools to create like foreign bindings between Rust and other languages?

***Participant***\
I think with Rust programming languages, it comes to using, you know, the various types of binding tools. I think it's a, an awesome, awesome experience and I can't complain. But it got to you. So they, they might be, you know, some kind of challenges in there. But it's been a nice experience, I would say. Yeah. This place.

**Interviewer**\
Do you ever have to like change the output of these tools? Like, are you just having them compile and run and then trusting the update or other cases where you've had to like go in and change the output because it's been incorrect or not quite what you expected.

***Participant***\
So only in real cases. I, I can maybe call an instance where I had to maybe edit it or do some kind of improvements. I think they just work for me to maybe, once I know that I need these binding tools. And then I can find myself, maybe trying to review the code or maybe trying to, how to edit or maybe, you know, no, no, it's a real case. I can't recall that.

**Interviewer**\
So more broadly, Rust has a bunch of these assumptions about memory, right, that, that it makes with aliasing with mutability. But those are very different than what other languages make about memory. So have there been any challenges that you encountered specifically, because you're using rust stuff a fine you have like one version or one view of memory on one side and then a different view of memory on the other.

***Participant***\
I think

**Interviewer**\
So I guess one, one particular. Like one example would be in rust you when you borrow something mutably. That also comes with the guarantee that that mutable reference to the object is unique. But with C and C plus plus, you don't get any guarantees whatsoever about whether a pointer is is like unique or shared. So, like, and that can lead to then undefined behavior if you are taking something that rust thinks is unique and then using it in a way that is actually shared.

***Participant***\
Yeah, yeah.

**Interviewer**\
Have you had any of those challenges.

***Participant***\
Of course, there are several challenges with the, with unsafe Rust and I think you mentioned one and defined behavior. And this may be one of the most common challenges. And sometimes it can lead to crashes or memory corruption. And multiple predictable program behaviors that you've had. You cannot even tell what it is or so, or maybe it's challenging to maybe to know or maybe how to locate where. It becomes a challenge. Also, maybe there's also memory safety violations. And I think this is a big one of movie. So, so I'm a major challenge with the unsafe Rust and and I think I was such challenges you can get in this movie, you can get some kind of an initialized memory. Or you can have maybe trouble creating data reassess or maybe performing valid point of operations. I think these kind of violations can be mostly to know how to back clashes or maybe data corruption and develop some kind of security vulnerabilities. And I think that this makes it hard to detect or maybe fixing memory that happens.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. So I guess those are all challenges with unsafe for us, you know, of itself, but have there been problems that you've observed when you're using Rust with other languages?

***Participant***\
Come on, yeah.

**Interviewer**\
Like when when you're using Rust FFI to call into other languages, are there any challenges that are specific to that?

***Participant***\
Yeah, maybe compatibility issues, the languages. Maybe compatibility issues.

**Interviewer**\
I guess which specific compatibility issues?

***Participant***\
To be specific, you can say, maybe development of maybe concurrency or parallelism. Of errors. And that is, they can be the question for it at times. And I think with these comments, some kind of challenges that you need to define customers. Am I trying to change devices? I'm having some... 

**Interviewer**\
No worries. So is there... 

***Participant***\
Just a sec. Can you hear me? 

**Interviewer**\
Yeah, I can still hear you. Do you need to change devices or do you think we'll be okay? 

***Participant***\
Let me try to switch devices as we speak. 

**Interviewer**\
So I guess describe a bug that you faced that involved unsafe Rust.

***Participant***\
A bug that I faced. So this time, we developed a code and it lagged to maybe... It had no compiler. It was so difficult to develop safety checks and maybe low level ...

***Participant***\
Hello. I appreciate for you being patient with me. I had to maybe do some kind of emergency calls. So I had to have them first. Sorry for that. 

**Interviewer**\
No worries. So just in the last couple of minutes, you're... Just one last question I have. I have a couple different... Sorry. No worries. I mean... Can you not hear me? Hello?

***Participant***\
Yes, please. 

**Interviewer**\
Okay, gotcha. So the last question is you mentioned in your survey that you've used like different sanitizers to test your code. And then... So let me double check this. Yeah, so you mentioned using... Yeah, Address Sanitizer, UBSan as well as MSan to find different bugs in code bases with on Safe Rust. So I guess my question is do these development tools handle all the problems that you faced running on Safe Rust? Or do you encounter problems that your tools can't solve?

***Participant***\
With sanitizers. Or just with any type of development tool?

**Interviewer**\
Like are there problems that you face in running on Safe Rust that your current tools that you use in development can't help you with?

***Participant***\
No. I think any specific type of problem that I've ever faced with on Safe Rust, I think they are proper tools that I can use to handle that.

**Interviewer**\
Gotcha. Which particular tools? Is it just the sanitizers that you've used in the past?

***Participant***\
Yes. Yes? Can you repeat?

**Interviewer**\
Oh, yeah. So you said that there are development tools that can help when you're working with, like that solve all your problems that you find with on Safe Rust or that there isn't a problem that you have that your tools can't solve. So is it just that the sanitizers that you use tend to cover all of the use cases you have?

***Participant***\
Yeah.
